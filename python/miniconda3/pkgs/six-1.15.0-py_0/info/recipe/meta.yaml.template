  summary: Python 2 and 3 compatibility utilities
  description: |
    Six provides simple utilities for wrapping over differences between
    Python 2 and Python 3. It is intended to support codebases that work on
    both Python 2 and 3 without modification. six consists of only one Python
    file, so it is painless to copy into a project.
